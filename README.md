# Nexter-proj-website

Nexter is a fictional Luxury home buying website. This is not my own website design but I created this website by myself from learning courses and seeing other websites. I know how to create each and every component for this type of website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
This website is completely based on brand new CSS technology which is CSS Grids.
I created this website to master my CSS grid skills.
